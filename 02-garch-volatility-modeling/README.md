# GARCH Volatility Modeling for FX & Commodities

**Objective:**  
Model and forecast volatility for FX or commodity assets using GARCH(1,1) and EWMA models.  
This project links directly to real-world work on cost volatility and margin-at-risk.

**Key components:**  
- Data loading & cleaning  
- EWMA and GARCH(1,1) estimation  
- Forecast comparison  
- Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES)  
- Stress scenario generation  
- Visualizations of volatility clustering

**Status:**  
Notebook in progress.
