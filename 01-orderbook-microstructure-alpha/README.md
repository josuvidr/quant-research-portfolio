# Order Book Microstructure Alpha

**Objective:**  
Explore whether limit order book (LOB) features - specifically order book imbalance — can predict short-horizon returns.  
This project replicates core ideas used in high-frequency and short-term predictive models.

**Key components:**  
- Order book imbalance signal  
- Short-horizon return computation  
- Feature engineering (spread, depth, mid-price changes)  
- Logistic regression / random forest prediction  
- Backtest framework for hit-rate & Sharpe  
- Statistical tests (AUC, accuracy, t-stats)

**Status:**  
Notebook in progress.
